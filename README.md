Problem Statement:</br>
We intend to perform image segmentation. Image segmentation means that we can group
similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. The grouping
problem is a clustering problem. We want to study the use of K-means on the Berkeley
Segmentation Benchmark.</br></br>
Steps done in this Assignment:
1. Download the dataset and understand the format
2. Create the Feature Space { Zero Crossing rate, Energy } [ used in 1D model ]
3. Convert the audio waveform to mel spectrogram and use this as the
feature space [ used in 2D model ]
4. Build a CNN architecture of your own [1D - 2D]
5. Compute the accuracy and F-Score for each model.
6. Plot the confusion matrices and find the most confusing classes.

</br></br>
Highest  accuracy:
1) In 1D Model = 43.9%
2) In 2D Model = 41.87%
